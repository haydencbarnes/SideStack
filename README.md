# SideStack Chrome Extension

SideStack is a vertical tab manager for Google Chrome focused on organizing browser sessions into **Spaces**. Each space keeps its own pinned tabs, suspended tabs, saved tab groups, and color theme so you can swap contexts quickly.

## Features

- Space Switcher: create, rename, delete, and activate isolated tab collections
- Theme customization: per-space light/dark mode and primary/secondary/accent colors
- Dark mode toggle in the popup
- Pin Tabs: syncs with Chrome pin state per space
- Search Tabs: fuzzy search across spaces, open tabs, suspended tabs, and saved groups
- Suspend Tabs: discard active tabs to free memory while keeping metadata per space
- De-duplicate Tabs: close duplicate URLs in the current window
- Save / Restore Tab Groups: snapshot Chrome tab groups and recreate them later
- Group Tabs by Domain: one-click grouping of open tabs by hostname

## Installation (Developer Mode)

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `/Users/hbarnes/Downloads/sidestack` directory

The extension icon will appear in the toolbar. Pin it for quicker access.

## Usage

- Click the SideStack action button to open the popup
- Use the left sidebar to switch between spaces or add new ones
- Type in the search box to fuzzy match spaces, tabs, suspended tabs, and saved groups
- Use the toolbar buttons to pin, suspend, dedupe, and organize tabs
- Toggle dark mode per space or customize themes via the Theme button
- Saved groups and suspension metadata persist in storage for future sessions

### Options Page

- Visit the extensionâ€™s **Options** page to adjust default themes, rename spaces, or import/export the stored configuration
- Import uses a JSON file generated by the export button

## Development Notes

- The background service worker lives in `background.js`
- Popup UI assets are under `popup/`
- A lightweight `nanoid` implementation sits in `vendor/`

### Code Quality

Before pushing new code, ensure it passes formatting and linting checks:

```bash
npx prettier --write "**/*.js"    # Format JavaScript files
npx eslint "**/*.js"              # Lint JavaScript files
```

### Recommended Commands

```bash
npm install              # (optional) set up tooling if you add build steps
# For linting added Python files, run `ruff check <paths>` per user preference
```

## Testing

Chrome extensions cannot run automated tests out of the box, so validate manually:

- Switch between spaces and confirm tab lists update
- Pin/unpin within spaces and ensure state tracks properly
- Suspend and restore tabs, verifying they reload when restored
- Save a tab group, close tabs, then restore the saved group
- Run de-duplication in a window with duplicate URLs and confirm only one remains

## Packaging

When ready for distribution:

1. Ensure manifest version and assets are up to date
2. From `chrome://extensions`, press **Pack extension...** and choose the project directory
3. Upload the generated CRX to the Chrome Web Store (Developer Dashboard)
